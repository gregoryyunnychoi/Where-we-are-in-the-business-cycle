This contains a replication of the MSCI Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples indices using the price-weighted method. MSCI publishes the top 10 publicly traded corporations for both discretionary and staple categories but does not provide historical data. The price-weighted method is used due to the unavailability of historical market capitalisation data on Yahoo Finance API function key.

Both indices are combined and arguably serve as leading indicators [1] of the FTSE 100 and the UK economy, especially due to their continuous nature, in contrast to other leading indicators that are only available monthly or quarterly.

For more information on the MSCI Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples indices, you can refer to MSCI's official documentation. 

[1] It goes without saying that a leading indicator serves no more than the purpose of an indicator, as opposed to a predictor of the benchmark index. A quick check using the Johansen test for cointegration and the Granger-causality test shows no long-term cointegrated trend nor short-term Granger-causality occurring for the two series of data. This is inspired by Mark Meldrum's series of videos during my study toward the CFA and is mainly a reference indicator, among many, for any sign of SLOWDOWN (as oppose to an expansion/growth) of an economy or the benchmark index.
