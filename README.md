This contains a replication of the MSCI Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples indices using the price-weighted method. MSCI publishes the top 10 publicly traded corporations for both discretionary and staple categories but does not provide historical data. The price-weighted method is employed due to the unavailability of historical market capitalisation data on Yahoo Finance.

Both indices are combined and arguably serve as leading indicators of the FTSE 100 and the UK economy, especially due to their continuous nature, in contrast to other leading indicators that are only available monthly or quarterly.

For more information on the MSCI Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples indices, you can refer to MSCI's official documentation.
