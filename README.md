This contains a replication of the MSCI consumer discretionary and consumer staple using price-weighted method. MSCI published the top 10 publicly traded corporations for both discretionary and staple categories, but does not include historical data. Price-weighted method is used simply due to unavailability of historical market capitalisation data on yfinance.  
Both index are combined and are shown as a leading indicator of the FTSE100 and the UK economy.
